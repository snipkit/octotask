- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/octotask/octotask.git
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```
- Set up environment variables:
  1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
  2. Add your API keys:
     ```bash
     GROQ_API_KEY=XXX
     HuggingFace_API_KEY=XXX
     OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
     ...
     ```
  3. Optionally set:
     - Debug level: `VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug`
     - Context size: `DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=32768`

**Note**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already in `.gitignore`.
